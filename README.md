Basic console game - school project

This is a meagre project by a humble beginner. Please don't judge me by my first footsteps into coding.

It is a console based game set in the ninth inning of a baseball game. 
You play the part of the ace closer who faces a slugger with the game on the line in the bottom of the ninth inning.
The game is simple. Get the batter out and win the game, or give up a hit and lose the game. 
No more complexity than that. I told you I was a beginner.
